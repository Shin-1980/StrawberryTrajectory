# Trajectory of Plant Growth

This app visualizes plant growth using three-dimensional models that dynamically change the shape based on the cursor position on the graph. The higher the mouse cursor points to the value of the leaf area, the larger the three-dimensional model becomes.

## How This App Works

This behaviour can be achieved by switching between three-dimensional models stored in this repository.

Three-dimensional models were basically taken at different times to capture the plant growth, resulting in varying frame origins. Because of this, adjustments are needed to shift the models accordingly to ensure alignment.
